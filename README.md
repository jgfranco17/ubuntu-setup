# Ubuntu Reinstallation Script

Knowing my tendency to mess up the OS, this script collections is everything I need to reinstall my Ubuntu environment.

## Running Scripts

In order to run the scripts, run the following with the name of the script to use.

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgfranco17/ubuntu-setup/main/scripts/<script name>.sh | sudo bash
```
